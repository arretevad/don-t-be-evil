# How to quit Gmail in 5 minutes

## Step 1: Sign up for an alternative
There are a  lot of options out there. Here is a short run down of some of our
favorites.

Most of the above services have their [own guides](https://hey.com/moving-from-gmail/) for helping you migrate, which
will be more specific/suited to them. Below are some general guidelines, but
feel free to skip reading if you have already found what you need!


## Step 2: Set up forwarding in Gmail

In Gmail settings, find the tab that says *"Forwarding and POP/IMAP"* (or click
[here](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#settings/fwdandpop)). You'll see a
button to "*Add a forwarding address*." Enter your new email from Step 1 and
follow the verification process.

Once the forwarding address is confirmed, go back to
[settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#settings/fwdandpop) and select the
option to "Forward a copy" to your new email address. Here, you'll also be
asked what Gmail should do with email after it's been forwarded. We suggest
selecting "*delete Gmail's copy*." Don't worry, you won't lose any email as
it'll already be showing up in your new inbox. You can always change this
setting later. A lot of folks will want to have Gmail keep forwarded emails until they
are more comfortable using their new email account.


If you don't want to forward your old email, you don't have to! Some folks will
relish the opportunity to start fresh with a new email address. Gmail isn't
going anywhere and all your old stuff will be there if you ever need it.

## Step 3: Migrate your existing email, contacts, and calendars

Much like Step 2, this is technically an optional step. If you want to be able to
access your contact list and older emails in your new email account, read on.
If not, skip ahead to Step 4. And, as mentioned above, many services have their
own guides and tools for importing your new data, so best to check there first.

You can find all your gmail contacts [(here)](https://contacts.google.com/). On
the sidebar, you'll find an "export" button. The most common/useful format will
likely be vCard, but you can choose whatever works with your new service.

Getting your existing email messages into your new account can be a little tricky.
There is no one way to do this, but we recommend following whatever guide your new
service provides. Of course, you can always download a copy of any (or all) your
Google data [via takeout](https://takeout.google.com). If you go this route, we recommend using mbox
format as it's the most common and will be compatible with other software out
there.

Of course, it's always a good idea to keep a backup of these files for your own
records!

## Step 4: That's it! You're done!

At this point, the only thing left to do is to break the habit of typing in
Gmail.com into your browser. Of course, there is a long tail of things you can opt
to do if you really want to. Most people will find it easier to do these over
time, at their own convenience.

1. Get your phone set up. Depending on which service you picked, you may need to
   download a dedicated app or you just may need to udpate your accounts in your
   existing mail app.
1. Update all the rest of your online accounts to point to your new email address.
1. Let friends and family know you have a new email (and even share this with
   them!). Since emails are getting forwarded, we find it easiest to just
   respond via the new address as emails are coming in. Adding a note to let
   folks know they should update their contact info since it's not always
   obvious that you are responding with a different address. If you plan on
   closing out your old email entirely (the ultimate goal) you'll likely want to
   send a note to anyone in your address book you haven't reached out to
   already.
1. Delete all your messages in Gmail, or even consider deleting your entire
   Google account. At this point, you should already have migrated all your old
   messages from Gmail into your new account. Any other data that Google has can
   be downloaded via [takeout](http://takeout.google.com). Deleting your account
   will prevent Google from tracking (and targeting) you going forward.


# FAQs
**Q: I don't want to pay for email!**

*A: 1) That's not a question. 2) You're already paying for email– the thing that
should scare you is that you don't really know **how** you're paying for it.
Nothing is free. [Hey.com said it best](https://hey.com/pricing/): with gmail,
you are paying with your privacy.*

**Q: Updating my email for all my accounts is annoying! Is there an easier way?**

*A: Not that we know of. You'll probably want to update your email for a few
important things like your bank account, credit cards, etc. but for most
things, it's probably okay if they are using an older email. You can take your
time and chip away at things. It's also a good opportunity to declutter your
email and close things out that you no longer use.*
